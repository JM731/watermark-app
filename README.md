This is a simple application where watermarks can be inserted onto images. The user can choose the font size and color, as well as upload a TTF file to change the font type.
Some images showing the app, as well as the end result of watermark insertion are displayed below (example images were generated by DALL-E 2). A Windows executable file containing the application is available for download at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TwSYPK14TBaOlulbHK0XI-JiTTbrW6_l?usp=drive_link.
